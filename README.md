Falldown
=======
Falldown is a remake of Falldown for the TI-83+ calculator.

Gameplay
--------
The object of the game is to survive for as long as possible. You are in control of a ball and can only move left or right. A series of walls with gaps emerge from the bottom of the screen; you must navigate through the gaps in time so you do not hit the top of the screen.

Note
----
I mainly wrote this to test automated Maven building when native files are involved. It's not a very good example of Slick2d, though it does work I suppose.
